# OnspringEnd2EndTests

A suite of automated web app tests for the [Onspring](https://onspring.com/) platform using:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)
- [Page Object Model Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (latest LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (latest LTS version)

### Installation

#### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/StevanFreeborn/OnspringEnd2EndTests.git
```

#### üíæ Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

#### üé≠ Install Playwright Dependencies

```sh
npx playwright install
```

#### üìù Create .env file

Copy the `example.env` file and rename it to `.env`

```sh
cp example.env .env
```

Update the `.env` file with values for your environment

## Usage

### Run all tests

```sh
npm run test
```

### Run all tests for specific browser

```sh
npx run test:chrome
```

-- or --

```sh
npx run test -- --project=chrome
```

### Run a specific suite of tests

```sh
npm run test -- app.spec.ts
```

### Run a specific test

```sh
npm run test -- -g "Delete a user"
```

### Run tests against specific target environment

A helpful script to run tests against a specific target environment without having to alter the `.env` file. Note you can pass all the same arguments as you would to `npm run test` to this script. But note the `--target` argument should come first followed by `--` and then the rest of the arguments you want to pass to the test script.

```sh
npm run test:env --target=<target> -- emailBody.spec.ts --project chrome
```

## Workflows

### [Playwright_Tests](./.github/workflows/playwright.yml)

This workflow runs the Playwright tests in a GitHub Actions workflow and allows you to supply an environment variable for the environment you want to run the tests against. It will only run when directly triggered by a user.

### [Lint_and_Format](./.github/workflows/lint_format.yml)

This workflow runs ESLint and Prettier against the codebase to ensure code quality and consistency. It will run on any pull request that merges into the `master` branch.

### [Acceptance_Test](./.github/workflows/accept_tests.yml)

This workflow will run on any pull request that aims to merge into the `master` branch. It will run all the tests found in `.spec.ts` files changed by the PR a total of 3 times in a row allowing for 1 retry to ensure the tests are stable. Making the allowance for 1 retry is an effort to reduce the number of false negatives due to transient timeouts.

## Relevant Notes

### Email Testing

Some tests require the ability to verify that an email was sent. This is currently done using IMAP and the `imap` package. You can read more about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imap). The email account for the system administrator user running the tests can be configured in the `.env` file.

When it is necessary to verify an email was sent to specific user currently an alias (e.g. `system.admin+<some unique identifier>@gmail.com`) is used to send the email to the system administrator user. The system administrator user's email account is configured in the `.env` file. The alias is then used to filter the emails in the inbox to find the email sent to the specific user.
