John Wick's To-Do List:

1. Eliminate the High Table.
2. Train for a marathon... while taking down bad guys.
3. Upgrade the arsenal - more guns, more style.
4. Find a new dog. (No more harm to them, promise!)
5. Perfect the art of brooding in the rain.
6. Get revenge, but make it look effortless.
7. Invest in bulletproof suits - fashion meets function.
8. Start a book club for hitmen - discuss life between contracts.
9. Develop a signature move - because every assassin needs one.
10. Practice one-liners for those dramatic moments.
